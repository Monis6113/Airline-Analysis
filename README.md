 # Airline Price Analysis & Visualization Project
 
 # Objective:
 
 As part of a hands-on data exploration project, I assumed the role of a data analyst working for a travel agency. The goal was to analyze a real-world airline dataset to understand the factors that influence flight pricing—particularly coach and first-class fares—and provide insights that can help clients secure better deals.

# Dataset Overview

The dataset includes detailed information about flights across the following categories:

**Flight Metrics:** miles, hours, delay, passengers

**Amenities:** inflight_meal, inflight_entertainment, inflight_wifi

**Timing Information:** day_of_week, weekend, redeye

**Pricing Information:** coach_price, firstclass_price

# Approach

**1. Data Exploration**
Reviewed data types, checked for nulls, and generated summary statistics.

Identified outliers and data distribution patterns.

**2. Univariate & Bivariate Analysis**
Visualized the distribution of coach and first-class ticket prices.

Explored how flight duration, miles traveled, and delays affect pricing.

Compared pricing trends on weekends vs. weekdays.

Analyzed the impact of in-flight amenities (WiFi, meals, entertainment) on ticket pricing.

**3. Visualization Techniques**

Used matplotlib and seaborn to generate:

Histograms

Scatter plots

Boxplots

Managed multiple plots using plt.show() and plt.clf() to keep visuals clean and organized.

# Key Insights

1)First-class fares increase significantly with longer flights and value-added amenities.

2)Coach prices show more variation based on demand factors like day of the week and weekend travel.

3)Redeye flights are generally cheaper in both classes.

4)Flights with longer delays tend to show slightly reduced average pricing—possibly due to lower demand.

# Tools & Libraries Used 
**Python**

**pandas – data manipulation**

**matplotlib, seaborn – data visualization**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques**

# Outcome
This project strengthened my data exploration and storytelling abilities—skills essential for a product. It sharpened my proficiency in identifying trends, segmenting users, and translating raw data into actionable business insights. Additionally, it helped me simulate the mindset of a data consultant delivering insights to internal or client-facing stakeholders.
