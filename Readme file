 Airline Price Analysis & Visualization Project
Objective:
As part of a hands-on data exploration project, I stepped into the role of a data analyst working for a travel agency. My goal was to analyze a real-world airline dataset to understand what factors influence flight prices—particularly coach and first-class fares—and provide insights that could help clients secure better deals on flights.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes detailed flight information across several features:

Flight Metrics: miles, hours, delay, passengers

Amenities: inflight_meal, inflight_entertainment, inflight_wifi

Timing Information: day_of_week, weekend, redeye

Pricing Information: coach_price, firstclass_price

Approach:

Data Exploration:
I began by getting familiar with the dataset—checking for data types, summary statistics, and potential anomalies.

Univariate & Bivariate Analysis:

Visualized the distribution of coach and first-class ticket prices.

Explored how flight duration, mileage, and delays relate to pricing.

Compared weekend vs. weekday pricing using bar plots and boxplots.

Investigated the influence of flight amenities (like wifi, meals, and entertainment) on pricing using grouped analysis.

Visualization Techniques:

Used Matplotlib for plotting various types of graphs such as histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots.

Ensured plots were rendered cleanly using plt.show() followed by plt.clf() to reset the plotting space.

Key Insights:

First-class fares increase significantly with longer flights and amenities.

Coach prices vary more based on demand factors like day of the week and weekends.

Redeye flights tend to be cheaper for both classes.

Flights with delays showed a subtle dip in average price, possibly due to lower demand.

Tools & Libraries Used:

Python (pandas, matplotlib)

Data visualization techniques

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Outcome:
This project helped me sharpen my ability to explore unfamiliar datasets, generate insights through visualizations, and think analytically like a data consultant. It strengthened my EDA and storytelling skills—critical when working in client-facing roles or presenting to non-technical stakeholders.
